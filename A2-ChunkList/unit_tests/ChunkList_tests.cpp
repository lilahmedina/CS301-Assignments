 * Created by Varick Erickson on 2/9/2021.
 *
 * You should not remove or change any of the tests in this file.
 * These are the same tests that will be used to grade your assignment.
 * If you want to run your own tests, it is recommended you use the provided
 * my_tests.cpp file.
 *
 * This runs all of the tests.
